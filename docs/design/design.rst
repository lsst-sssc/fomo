FOMO's Design Documentation
================================

The diagram below (adapted from Henry Hsieh's original) shows the place where
FOMO fits in to the overall LSST Solar System Follow-Up Ecosystem:

Detailed Design Diagrams and Documentation
-------------------------------------------

The design diagrams below follow the `C4 model <https://c4model.com>`_ philosphy
for visualizing the software's architecture. A set of hierarchical diagrams are
used to present the system context, the containers, and the components of those
containers  (There is a fourth code layer, but that is not presented here).

System Context
