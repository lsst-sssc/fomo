What is FOMO?
-------------------

FOMO, which stands for Follow-up Observations of Moving Objects is a Target and Observation Manager (TOM) built using the `TOM Toolkit <https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/>`_ (see also `Street et al. (2018) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018SPIE10707E..11S>`_) intended for coordinating follow-up observations of "interesting" Solar System targets, primarily from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
