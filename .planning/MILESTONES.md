# Milestones

## 1.0 Site/Ephemeris Helper (Shipped: 2026-06-14)

**Phases completed:** 1 phases, 2 plans, 4 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Observatory model gains a timezone field and to_earth_location(), migration 0002 seeds 4 telescope sites (Magellan-Clay/Baade, NTT, FTS), and a new telescope_runs.py computes dip-corrected sunset/sunrise (-(0.833+dip)) and -15deg dark-window UTC crossing times via astropy get_sun/AltAz with coarse-scan + bisection root-finding.
- Extended test_telescope_runs.py with skycalc-accuracy validation for 4 June 2026 Las Campanas nights, a -18deg astronomical-twilight cross-check matching 19:16/06:08 Santiago local to the second, and zoneinfo DST-offset tests for Santiago/Sydney - all passing with ruff check/format clean.
